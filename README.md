# AlarmWebApp
The project provides the user with an interactive alarm application.

The alarm clock features a time input field and a Set Alarm button. The user can select a time for the alarm to go off and dismiss or snooze the alarm for 5 minutes.

When the set alarm time is reached, the app plays audible music and displays a text on the application.

There are separate Light and Dark Modes, which can be toggled with the help of a simple switch to enhance the application's usability for both day and night.

Some keyboard shortcuts have also been provided to enhance the user functionality.
